aChat: A real-time chat application, based on WebSockets, used for meeting up with some random strangers and keeping your identity anonymous.

###### Features
- Real-time interaction with WebSockets
- Video and Audio calls using WebRTC
###### Things to learn
- How to create a basic node chat application, for say 200 users.
- Solving complexities like reconnection after server restart.
- Scaling the server with a cluster of node applications, using docker, and still maintaining an internode connection between all sockets/users.
- Large scaling for a million users and load testing.
